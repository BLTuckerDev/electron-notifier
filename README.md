# Electron Notifier

Electron Notifier is an angular2 electron app that allows you to set periodic notifications for your
desktop. I created it to give myself a reason to play with angular2 and electron. 
This app was built after following along with this tutorial: http://onehungrymind.com/electron-angular-2-things/
I highly recommend the One Hungry Mind blog for tutorials on angular and web development in general.

I also made use of this angular2 quick start project for the angular side of things:
